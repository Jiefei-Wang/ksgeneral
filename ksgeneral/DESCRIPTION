Title: Computing the Two-Sided Kolmogorov-Smirnov Distribution When the
        Underlying cdf is (Dis)continuous
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Senren Tan

Description: This package contains a proposed revision to the stats::ks.test() and dgof::ks.test() functions, improving the speed and accuracy of the one-sample two-sided Kolmogorov-Smirnov test when the underlying cdf is continuous or purely discrete, by using the FFT-based algorithm. It also adds features necessary for doing one-sample tests with hypothesized mixed distributions. The package also contains cont_ks_c_cdf(), disc_ks_c_cdf(), mixed_ks_c_cdf() functions, computing the complementary cdf for the KS statistic when the hypothesized distribution is continuous, discrete, mixed, respectively.
